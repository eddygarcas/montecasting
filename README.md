# Montecasting

Montecasting will provide a set of forecasting techniques to be used on software project management or product development. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'montecasting'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install montecasting

## Usage
#### Metrics

    Montecasting::Metrics.variance array_of_time = []

    Montecasting::Metrics.wip_limit array_of_time = [], start_date, end_date
    
    Montecasting::Metrics.thoughtput number_or_items, start_date, end_date
    
    Montecasting::Metrics.week_days start_date, end_date
    
#### Charts
All methods in this section will be returned in a format that, so far, has been tested using rickshaw JavaScript toolkit for creating interactive real-time graphs.
